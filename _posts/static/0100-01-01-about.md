title: "What's a #BirthdaySprint?"
---

On August 10th, 2013 there will be birthday celebrations around the world for OpenStreetMap's 9th birthday. In order to celebrate, we've decided to hold a distributed code sprint during the birthday weekend. What this means is that anyone with an OSM software project can rally their community to do a dedicated push over those two days. Our goal is to energize developers around the project's anniversary. 

The following projects will be participating-- feel free to add yours!
