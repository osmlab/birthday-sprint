title: "What's a #BirthdaySprint?"
---

On August 10th, 2013 there will be birthday celebrations around the world for OpenStreetMap's 9th birthday. In order to celebrate, we've decided to hold a distributed code sprint during the birthday weekend. What this means is that anyone with an OSM software project can rally their community to do a dedicated push over those two days. Our goal is to energize developers around the project's anniversary. 

The following projects will be participating-- feel free to add yours!

* OSM Groups (Sprint Leads-- Martijn, RichardF)
* HOT website sprint (Sprint Leads-- Clara, Felix)
* HOT cross-site tool bar (Sprint Leads-- Mikel, ???)
* Complete iD integration into tasking server (Sprint Leads-- SteveK?)
* WikiMaps (Sprint Lead -- Susanna Ånäs http://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/historic/2013-July/000290.html)
* [Historical OSM](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap)- Time aware Tiles ( Sprint Lead -- Jeff Meyer)
* Hashtag aggregator (Sprint Lead -- Mike Migurski)
* Social feature planning, UX workshop (Sprint Leads: Mike Migurski, Kathleen)
