title: "What's a #BirthdaySprint?"
---

On August 10th, 2013 there will be birthday celebrations around the world for OpenStreetMap's 9th birthday. In order to celebrate, we've decided to hold a distributed code sprint during the birthday weekend. What this means is that anyone with an OSM software project can rally their community to do a dedicated push over those two days. Our goal is to energize developers around the project's anniversary. 

The following projects will be participating-- feel free to add yours!

## OSM Groups

* Description: We are pushing to get the Groups Feature ready for an initial launch!
* Issues: [This wiki page](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/wiki/Groups) has gathered the needs. Also, we [label issues related to the groups branch with 'groups'](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/issues?labels=groups&page=1&state=open).
* Code: The [groups sketch tree](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/tree/groups-sketch) is where we're working.
* We have a [live instance](http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/) here that has the working functionality. You need a separate account on the dev instance to gain access to all functionality. See a sample group [here](http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/groups/2).
